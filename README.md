welcome to my github profile. here are some things to do around these parts

- buy the first glass beach album [on bandcamp](https://glassbeach.bandcamp.com/album/the-first-glass-beach-album)
- pick up rolller skating
- subscribe to The Dear Hunter [on pillar](https://pillar.club/thedearhunter)
- get involved with harm reduction
- check out [my last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/raftario)

you can also stick around and take a look at my projects. i like to experiment with all sorts of things so you'll find a lot of random stuff, but i always find myself coming back to networked io and rust. enjoy !
